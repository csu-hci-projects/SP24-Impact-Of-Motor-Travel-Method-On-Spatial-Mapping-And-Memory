## Engine and Application Requirements
### Unreal Engine 5
 - Download and install UE5.3.2, as the project was built and coded for this version

### Python
 - Download python version 3.11 and add it to your PATH

## Plugin Requirements for Unreal Engine 5
### External Plugins to Download
 - [VR Expansion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/104V1FrbI58LGB-3-5i0HOiOHYyjRwmec/view)
 - [Victory Plugin](https://www.mediafire.com/file/g0n7a4d35mf25p9/VictoryPlugin53.zip/file)

### Unreal Engine 5 Builting Plugins to Enable
 - "Json Blueprint Utilities"

### Installing the Plugins
 - The external plugins need to be separately downloaded and put into your UE5.3/Engine/Plugins folder.
 - To install the builtin plugins, first create a blank project, then in the editor go to Edit > Plugins and search for the plugin(s) to enable
 - Once the plugin(s) have been enabled, reload your UE5 editor and load the Locomotion_Sim project.

## Running the Unreal Engine 5 VR Experience
 - Make sure you have all of the plugins installed, as you cannot properly open the Locomotion_Sim project without having everything setup.
 - ...

## Generating the 2D Map of The Test Environment
### Setting up your Venv
 - All python files are located in Locomotion_Sim > Python
 - If on windows, run the setup_venv.bat file to setup and install the venv and necessary libraries

### Generating the 2D Map
 - Run the generate_2d_map.bat file every time you want to create a new 2D image of the 3D test environment.
 - This will create a new, unique image from the current map_output.json file.
 - Notably, whenever a new 3D test environment is generated by running the Unreal Engine 5 project, "map_output.json" will be overwritten.
